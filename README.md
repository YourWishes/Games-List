# Games List
## What?
Personal repository for tracking and maintaining an accurate collection of my Video Game Collection.

## Why?
I have a lot of video games, sometimes I forget what I do/do not have. In the moment when I may need to check what I have it can be difficult to remember exactly what I do have. This repository is setup to simplify this process.

## How?
You could clone the repo, run yarn start and use the built-in create-react-app to view the site, it's useful for me for sorting and a nice GUI, but to keep it simple you can view the CSV by clicking the link below and see the data formatted within github.
